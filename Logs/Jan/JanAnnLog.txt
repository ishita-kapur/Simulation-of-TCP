Yes! Donâ€™t be angry.  Please.

I love you very much â€¦ [She clasps his hand again.] â€¦ but canâ€™t you hear how they are hammering out there?!  They are pounding away, and something seems to be falling, breaking apart, some kind of wall seems to be coming downâ€”the earth is changingâ€”and it is so spacious and wide and free!  Itâ€™s night now, but it seems to me the sun is shining!  Iâ€™m thirty years old and already Iâ€™m like an old woman, I know it, you can see it in my face.  And yet â€¦ tonight I feel like Iâ€™m only seventeen, and that Iâ€™ve fallen in love for the first timeâ€”a great, boundless love that lights up the sky!
